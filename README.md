# app-load-testing-ag
Solution for the Allan Gray coding challenge

## Context
Load testing is a type of performance testing that invloves simulating a high number of concurrent users or transactions to asses system response times, resource utilization and overall stability.\
It helps identify bottlenecks, vulnerabilities and performance issues, ensuring that the system can handle the expected load without compromising its functionality and user experience.

## Task 
Create an application to hit a supplied HTTP endpoint a variable number of times, returning information and statistics about response times, bytes sent, and so on\
Additionally, provide an easy way to view the output of this application in a manner that is easy to read and interpret.

## Running the program
Pre-requisite - must have python and pip installed\
In the root directory, use a terminal to run the command "make", this will install the necessary dependecies\ 
Then run the command "make run" to run the server. In case of any errors, manually run the server.py file in your terminal or in any capable IDE.\
Once the server is running, on the terminal you will see *Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080* - Enter this url in your browser on the same device.
